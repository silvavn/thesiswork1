# Ongoing project

In this repository I maintain records of the work that I am doing for my Master's Degree in Computing Science at University of Alberta under the supervision of Dr. Joerg Sander. 

At first, I am re-implementing the MONIC framework in a visual and practical form using Python, Tkinter and Sklearn.

This repository is meant for progress tracking and supervision.
